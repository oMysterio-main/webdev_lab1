<p> Hello! My name is Gabriel Ornelas. I come from Mansueto High School, home of the Leopards!</p>
<p>Currently, I am majoring in Game Design and Experiential Media with hopes to create enjoyable experiences for everyone!</p>
In this course, I hope to be able to create websites on my own, and have it polished to appeal to an audience.
